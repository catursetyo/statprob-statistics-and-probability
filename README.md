## 🧐 About the Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in **Statistics and Probability**. The primary goal is to demonstrate proficiency in:
* **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning and preparing real-world datasets (Kaggle).
* **Statistical Inference:** Applying hypothesis testing and probability theory to draw conclusions.
* **Data Visualization:** Communicating insights through effective plotting.
